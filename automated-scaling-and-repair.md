CockroachDB transparently manages scale with an upgrade path from a single node to hundreds. Easily add capacity to the cluster by starting new storage containers and CockroachDB automatically rebalances existing data. Kill a container and CockroachDB re-replicates its data from available sources. With a simple configuration change you can even scale between cloud service providers or migrate your entire service without downtime.

-	Add resources to scale horizontally, with zero hassle and no downtime
-	Self-organizes, self-heals, and automatically rebalances
-	Migrate data seamlessly between clouds
