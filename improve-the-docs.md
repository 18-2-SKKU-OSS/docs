## Write Docs

We're still working out our overall docs plan, so these instructions are a bit premature. Once we've established a comfortable baseline, here's how you'll be able to help:

1. Review the [README.md](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/blob/master/README.md) to understand how the docs are put together and how to get yourself set up.
2. Fork the [docs repository](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs).
3. [Create a clone of your fork](https://github.com/jseldess/docs-2.git) locally on your computer.
4. Make your changes and push them to your fork.
5. Back in the CockroachDB docs repo, [open a pull request](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pulls).
