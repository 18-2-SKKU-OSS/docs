## Write Docs

We're still working out our overall docs plan, so these instructions are a bit premature. Once we've established a comfortable baseline, here's how you'll be able to help:

1. Review [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand how the docs are put together and to get yourself set up.
2. Fork the [docs repository](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs).
3. [Create a local clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) of your fork.
4. Make your changes and [push to your remote fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).
5. Back in the CockroachDB docs repo, [open a pull request](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pulls).
