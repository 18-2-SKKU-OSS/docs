<!--
## `CAST()`

there are three syntaxes for dates: `'2016-01-01'::date`, `CAST('2016-01-01' AS DATE)`, and `DATE '2016-01-01'`. the docs should probably prefer the latter form

the `CAST()` function should get its own documentation somewhere; Iâ€™m not sure if it needs to be mentioned again in the date section. The `::` form should probably only be mentioned as an alternative to `CAST()`
