### Upgrade procedure

* This release cannot be run concurrently with older beta releases.
  Please stop all nodes running older releases before restarting any
  node with this version.

### New Features

* `UPDATE` statements may now set columns which are part of the
  primary key.
  [#6043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6043)
* `CHECK` constraints can now be defined when creating tables and will
  be enforced in `INSERT` statements (but not yet for `UPDATE`
  statements)
  [#6044](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6044)
* The `pow()` and `exp()` functions on `DECIMAL` values no longer lose
  precision.
  [#6170](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6170)
* In the `cockroach sql` shell, the special command `\!` can be used
  to execute a system command and display its output. `\|` executes a
  system command and runs its output as a SQL statement.
  [#5961](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5961)
* Added `SHOW CREATE TABLE`.
  [#6158](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6158)
* The `RETURNING` clause of `INSERT` statments can now refer to tables
  by aliases defined with `AS`.
  [#5903](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5903)
* The SQL parser now accepts the options `CASCADE` and `RESTRICT` on
  the commands `DROP INDEX`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE DROP
  COLUMN`, and `ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT`. These keywords relate to
  features we have not yet implemented so they do nothing, but this
  improves compatibility with frameworks that like to send these
  keywords anyway.
  [#5957](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5957)

### Admin UI

* The time scale used for graphs can now be changed.
  [#6145](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6145)
* Some UI elements now include tooltips with additional explanations.
  [#6006](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6006)
* A warning is displayed when the cluster is unreachable.
  [#6042](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6042)
* There are now fewer unnecessary scrollbars.
  [#6018](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6018)

### Bug fixes

* The rebalancer is now better at distributing ranges across the nodes
  in a cluster.
  [#6133](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6133)
* Fixed a major cause of "timestamp in future" errors.
  [#5845](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5845)
* Fixed several potential panics.
  [#6111](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6111)
  [#6143](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6143)

### Performance improvements

* Improved performance of schema changes while the data is being
  modified.
  [#5996](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5996)
* The RPC subsystem is now bypassed for requests to the local node.
  [#6021](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6021)
* Information about completed transactions is now cleaned up more
  efficiently.
  [#5882](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5882)
* Fixed a leak of goroutines.
  [#6010](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6010)
* Reduced memory allocations on the critical path.
  [#6117](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6117)
  [#6119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6119)
  [#6140](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6140)
