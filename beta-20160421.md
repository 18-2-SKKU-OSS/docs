---

## Apr 21, 2016

### Upgrade Procedure

* This release cannot be run concurrently with older beta releases.
  Please stop all nodes running older releases before restarting any
  node with this version.

### New Features

* [`UPDATE`](update.html) statements may now set columns which are part of the
  primary key.
  [#6043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6043)
* `CHECK` constraints can now be defined when creating tables and will
  be enforced for [`INSERT`](insert.html) statements (but not yet for [`UPDATE`](update.html)
  statements).
  [#6044](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6044)
* The `pow()` and `exp()` [functions](functions-and-operators.html) on `DECIMAL` values no longer lose
  precision.
  [#6170](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6170)
* In the [`cockroach sql`](use-the-built-in-sql-client.html) shell, the special command `\!` can now be used
  to execute a system command and display its output. `\|` executes a
  system command and runs its output as a SQL statement.
  [#5961](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5961)
* Added `SHOW CREATE TABLE`.
  [#6158](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6158)
* The `RETURNING` clause of [`INSERT`](insert.html) statements can now refer to tables
  by aliases defined with `AS`.
  [#5903](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5903)
* The SQL parser now accepts the `CASCADE` and `RESTRICT` keywords in
  the [`DROP INDEX`](drop-index.html), [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate.html), [`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN`](alter-table.html), and [`ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT`](alter-table.html) statements. These keywords relate to
  features we have not yet implemented, so they do nothing, but this change
  improves compatibility with frameworks that like to send these
  keywords.
  [#5957](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5957)

### Admin UI

* The time scale used for graphs can now be changed.
  [#6145](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6145)
* Some UI elements now include tooltips with additional explanations.
  [#6006](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6006)
* A warning is displayed when the cluster is unreachable.
  [#6042](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6042)
* There are now fewer unnecessary scrollbars.
  [#6018](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6018)

### Bug fixes

* The rebalancer is now better at distributing ranges across the nodes
  in a cluster.
  [#6133](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6133)
* Fixed a major cause of "timestamp in future" errors.
  [#5845](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5845)
* Fixed several potential panics.
  [#6111](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6111)
  [#6143](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6143)

### Performance Improvements

* Improved the performance of schema changes while data is being
  modified.
  [#5996](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5996)
* The RPC subsystem is now bypassed for requests to the local node.
  [#6021](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6021)
* Information about completed transactions is now cleaned up more
  efficiently.
  [#5882](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/5882)
* Fixed a leak of goroutines.
  [#6010](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6010)
* Reduced memory allocations on the critical path.
  [#6117](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6117)
  [#6119](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6119)
  [#6140](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6140)
  [#6141](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6141)
  [#6142](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6142)

### Doc Improvements

* Overview of [SQL privileges](privileges.html).
* Summaries and required privileges for all supported [SQL statements](sql-statements.html).
* Reference docs for [`DROP DATABASE`](drop-database.html), [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.html), [`GRANT`](grant.html), [`RENAME DATABASE`](rename-database.html), [`RENAME TABLE`](rename-table.html), [`REVOKE`](revoke.html), and [`SHOW INDEX`](show-index.html).
