### New Features

* The `INSERT` now accepts an `ON CONFLICT` clause, for a more
  flexible alternative to `UPSERT`.
  [#6591](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6591)
* The new `EXPLAIN (TYPES)` subcommand prints information about the
  types of expressions in a statement.
  [#6482](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6482)
* Added the aggregate functions `BOOL_AND()` and `BOOL_OR()`
  [#6535](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6535)
* The aggregate functions `SUM(INT)` and `AVG(INT)` now return
  `DECIMAL` instead of `INT` and `FLOAT` respectively.
  [#6532](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6532)
* New command-line flag `--raft-tick-interval` allows the raft
  heartbeat frequency to be changed in high-latency deployments.
  [#6615](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6615)
* `TIMESTAMP` values can now be cast to type `STRING`.
  [#6605](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6605)
* The `CREATE DATABASE` command now accepts an `ENCODING` option for
  compatibility with PostgreSQL, although `UTF8` is the only supported
  encoding.
  [#6614](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6614)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug when a single `INSERT` statement inserts multiple values
  for the same primary key.
  [#6564](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6564)
* Fixed an inconsistency that could occur when a transaction in
  `SNAPSHOT` isolation used the internal `DeleteRange` operation.
  [#6548](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6548)
* Fixed an integer underflow that could result in log messages like
  `transport: http2Server received 4294965918-bytes`.
  [#6567](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6567)
* Long-running transactions are no longer allowed to exceed their
  table descriptor lease.
  [#6418](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6418)
* Subtracting an `INTERVAL` from a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` returns
  a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` instead of one without a time zone.
  [#6540](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6540)
* Improved type checking of comparisons involving tuples.
  [#6517](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6517)
* `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `DROP INDEX` now do more
  validation of their arguments.
  [#6492](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6492)


### Performance improvments

* Improved tracking of keys modified during a transaction, improving
  performance of bulk inserts.
  [#6611](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6611)
* Schema changes can now continue past transient errors.
  [#6552](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6552)
