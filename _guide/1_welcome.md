## What is CockroachDB?

CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on top of a transactional and consistent key:value store. The primary design goals are support for ACID transactions, horizontal scalability, and survivability, hence the name. CockroachDB implements a Raft consensus algorithm for consistency. It aims to tolerate disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention. CockroachDB nodes (RoachNodes) are symmetric; a design goal is homogenous deployment (one binary) with minimal configuration.
 

 

 

## Who is CloudCannon for?

CloudCannon allows non-technical teams to take control of their website and developers to build websites faster. Agencies are using CloudCannon to deliver updatable websites to clients. Enterprises have their marketing teams update websites without interrupting developers.

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator. What this really means is that Jekyll is a program that takes your content written in HTML, Markdown and other markup languages, passes it through templates and outputs a completely static website.

## How does CloudCannon work?

Getting a website online and updatable is easy with CloudCannon.

1. The website files are synced to CloudCannon using Github, BitBucket, Dropbox or a File Upload.
2. CloudCannon makes your website live on a generated subdomain (\*.cloudvent.net) or your own domain name.
3. Add `class="editable"` to elements in the HTML you want to be updatable.
4. Share the site with the rest of the team.


Other developers get full access to the source code. Non-technical users can easily manage the content of site without writing code.
