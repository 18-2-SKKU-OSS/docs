### New Features

* The `SERIAL` column type is now supported as an alias for `INT DEFAULT unique_rowid()`. TODO(jseldess): link to caveats when merged
* `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart` is now optional; reissuing the original `SAVEPOINT cockroach_restart` has the same effect. This improves compatibility with some client drivers. [#6955](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6955)
* `FAMILY` is now a reserved word in the SQL dialect in preparation for a future feature. [#7069](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7069)

### Bug Fixes

* The command-line SQL shell is now able to print non-ASCII characters. [#7045](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7045), [#7048](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7048)
* Commands issued with a timestamp outside the garbage collection window will now always fail. [#6992](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6992)
* All aggregate functions now return NULL when run on a table with no rows. [#7043](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7043)

### Performance Improvements

* [`jemalloc`](http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/) is now used as the memory allocator for the C++ portions of the server. The build tag `stdmalloc` can be used to switch back to the standard `malloc`. [#7006](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7006)
* Raft logs are now garbage collected more aggressively. This should generally make snapshots smaller, reducing memory pressure, but sometimes it may cause more snapshots to be sent. [#7040](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7040)
* Reduced allocations in insert and update statements involving secondary indexes. [#7011](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7011)
* Improved performance of conditional puts with no existing value. [#7016](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7016)
* Improved performance of small transactions. [#7015](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7015)
