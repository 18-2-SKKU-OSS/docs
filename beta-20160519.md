### Backwards-Incompatible Changes

* Timestamps are now truncated to microsecond resolution when sent
  over the network for compatibility with the PostgreSQL protocol. The
  `format_timestamp_ns(ts)` or `extract(nanosecond from ts)` functions
  can be used to access the full nanosecond precision of a timestamp.
  The functions `now()`, `current_timestamp()`, and
  `statement_timestamp()` are truncated to microsecond resolution to
  avoid confusion when timestamp values are used in unique indexes;
  the new function `current_timestamp_ns()` can be used to get a
  non-truncated timestamp.

### New Features

* `DO NOTHING` is now supported in `ON CONFLICT` clauses.
  [#6633](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6633)
* `CHECK` constraints can now be specified at the table level.
  [#6625](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6625)
* Binary encoding is now supported in the network protocol for `BOOL`,
  `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`, and `STRING` types, improving compatiblity with
  some PostgreSQL drivers.
  [#6661](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6661)
* A new command `cockroach halt-cluster` has been added to the
  command-line interface; this will be used in the upgrade process for
  a future beta releasea.

### Bug Fixes

* `EXPLAIN DELETE` no longer executes the `DELETE` command.
  [#6622](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6622)
* `CHECK` constraints are now enforced during `UPDATE` statments.
  [#6753](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6753)
* `CHECK` constraints work correctly when columns have been dropped.
  [#6730](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6730)
* Tuples and the `DEFAULT` keyword now work in `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
  clauses. [#6636](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6636)
* Errors are now reported with standard PostgreSQL error codes in more
  places. [#6652](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6652),
  [#6554](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6554)
* Fixed a panic while a node is attempting a clean shutdown.
  [#6677](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6677)
* Internal retry logic has been improved so requests are no longer
  stuck retrying endlessly on the wrong replica.
  [#6688](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6688)

### Performance Improvements

* Snapshot generation is now throttled to reduce peak memory
  consumption.
  [#6632](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6632)
* Improved performance for transactions with low contention.
  [#6413](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6413)
* Improved performance for `UPSERT` statements (and the equivalent `ON
  CONFLICT DO UPDATE` statements) if the table has no secondary
  indexes and values are supplied for all columns in the table.
