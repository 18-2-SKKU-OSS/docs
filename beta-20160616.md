### Deprecation Notice

* Integers with a leading zero (e.g. `0755`) are currently treated as octal. This will be changed to ignore leading zeros and treat the numbers as decimal in a future release. [#7205](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7205)

### New Features

* `SELECT` statements now accept an `AS OF SYSTEM TIME` clause to read values from the recent past (up to the GC policy set in the zone configuration). [#7139](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7139)
* Hexadecimal byte string literals of the form `x'f00d'` can now be used to create byte strings containing arbitrary characters. [#7138](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7138)
* `BIGSERIAL` and `SMALLSERIAL` are now supported as aliases for `SERIAL`. All three types use the same 64-bit value size. [#7187](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7187)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a panic in some uses of subqueries. [#6994](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6994), [#7146](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7146)
* `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` now allows the addition of columns with a uniqueness constraint only when the table is empty. [#7094](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7094)
* Improved availability when `--raft-tick-interval` is increased from its default value. [#7086](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7086)
* Improved reporting of errors from single statements run outside transactions. [#7080](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7080)
* Invalid octal literals (e.g. `09`) no longer crash the server. [#7134](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7134)
* When `ALTER TABLE` fails, it now rolls back dependent items in the correct order. [#6789](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6789)
* Aggregate functions like `SUM()` are no longer allowed in `CHECK` or `DEFAULT` expressions. [#7221](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7221)

### Performance Improvements

* Improved rate limiting of snapshots during rebalancing, reducing memory usage and improving availability. [#6878](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/6878)
* Splitting a range that has grown beyond the target size is now faster. [#7118](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7118)
* Raft elections are now initiated lazily instead of shortly after server startup. [#7085](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7085)
* The raft log is now garbage-collected more eagerly. [#7125](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7125)
* Increased RocksDB block size, which reduces memory usage. [#7219](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/7219)
