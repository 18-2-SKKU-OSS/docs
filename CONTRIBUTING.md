# Contributing to CockroachDB Docs

The CockroachDB docs are open source just like the database itself. We welcome your contributions!

## Setup

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). CockroachDB uses Jekyll to transform markdown and layout files into a complete, static HTML site. You need to install Jekyll so you can view doc changes locally.

2. Install [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer). This tool lets you check the HTML generated by Jekyll for errors (broken internal and external links, missing images, etc.).  

3. Learn the essentials of our [Docs Structure](#docs-structure). 

4. Review our simple [Style Guide](#style-guide).

## Get Started

Once you're ready to contribute:

1.  Fork the CockroachDB [docs repository](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs).

2.  [Create a local clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) of your fork.

3.  Make your changes.

4.  [Build and test the docs locally](#build-and-test-the-docs-locally).

5.  [Push to your remote fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).

6.  Back in the CockroachDB docs repo, [open a pull request](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/pulls) and assign it to `jseldess`.

We'll review your changes, providing feedback and guidance as necessary. Also, CircleCI, the system we use to automate tests, will run the markdown files through Jekyll and then run [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) against the resulting HTML output to check for errors. CircleCI will also attempt to sync the HTML to an AWS server, but since you'll be working on your own fork, this part of the process will fail; don't worry about the CircleCI fail status.    

## Keep Contributing

If you want to regularly contribute to the CockroachDB docs, there are a few things we recommend:

1. Note that our "master" branch is called `gh-pages`.

2. Make it easy to bring updated docs into your fork by tracking us upstream:

    ``` shell
    $ git remote add --track gh-pages upstream https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs.git
    ```

3. When you're ready to make your next round of changes, get our latest docs:

    ``` shell
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git merge upstream/gh-pages
    ```

4. Repeat the write, build, push, pull flow from the [Get Started](#get-started) section above.

## Docs Structure

### Pages

Each docs page must be an `.md` file in the root directory of the repository, must be written in the [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) dialect of Markdown, and must start with the following front-matter:

```
---
title: Title of Page
summary: Short description of page for SEO
toc: false
---
```
 
- `title`: Used as the h1 header.
- `summary`: Used as the page's `meta description` for SEO. Keep this under 155 characters. Consider using the first sentence of the page, or something similar.
- `toc`: Adds an auto-generated table of contents to the page. See [Page TOC](#page-toc) for full details.

### Page TOC 

The CockroachDB Jekyll theme can auto-generate a page-level table of contents listing all h2 headers or all h2 and h3 headers on the page. Related files: `js/toc.js` and `_includes/toc.html`. 

#### TOC Placement

-   To add a page TOC to the very top of the page, set `toc: true` in the page's front-matter.

-   To add a page TOC anywhere else on the page (for example, after an intro paragraph), set `toc: false` in the page's front-matter and add the following HTML where you want the toc to appear on the page:
    
    ``` html
    <div id="toc"></div>
    ```

-   To omit a page TOC from the page, set `toc: false` in the page's front-matter.

#### TOC Levels

By default, a page TOC includes h2 and h3 headers. To limit a page TOC to h2 headers only, set `toc_not_nested: true` in the page's front-matter. 

### Sidebar

The [`_data/sidebar_doc.yml`](_data/sidebar_doc.yml) file controls which pages appear in the docs sidebar. If you're adding a page that you think should appear in the sidebar, please mention this in your pull request.

### Auto-Included Content

Some pages auto-include content from the [`_includes`](_includes) directory. For example, each SQL statement page inludes a syntax diagram from `_includes/sql/diagrams`, and [build-a-test-app.md](build-a-test-app.md) includes code samples from `_includes/app`.

The syntax for including content is `{% include <filepath> %}`, for example, `{% include app/basic-sample.rb %}`.

## Style Guide

CockroachDB docs should be:

- Clear 
- Correct 
- Concise 

## Build and Test the Docs Locally

Once you've installed Jekyll and have a local clone of the docs repository, you can build and test the docs as follows:

1.  From the root directory of your clone, run:
    
    ``` shell
    $ jekyll serve
    ```

2.  Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/docs/` and manually check your changes.

    - If the page you want to test isn't listed in the sidebar, just point to it directly, for example, `http://127.0.0.1:4000/docs/new-page.html`.

    - When you make additional changes, Jekyll automatically regenerates the HTML content. No need to stop and re-start Jekyll; just refresh your browser.

    Once you're done viewing your changes, use **CTRL + C** to stop the Jekyll server.

3.  Run automated tests against the Jekyll-generate HTML files to check for problems (broken links, missing alt texts for images, etc.):

    ``` shell
    $ htmlproofer ./_site --allow-hash-href true
    ```
