{{site.data.alerts.callout_info}} `--background` is suitable for writing automated test suites or maintenance procedures that need a temporary server process running in the background. It is not intended to be used to start a long-running server, because it does not fully detach from the controlling terminal.  Consider using a service manager or a tool like [daemon(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=daemon&sektion=8) instead.{{site.data.alerts.end}}
